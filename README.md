This project is a two-player version of the classic Battleship game implemented in Python. 
Players take turns placing their ships on a 10x10 grid, choosing both the position and orientation (horizontal or vertical) for each ship.
*Make sure that when placing ships, H faces east and V faces south. If it goes off-grid or overlaps with another ship, you will be prompted*
Once ship placement is complete, players alternate turns attacking their opponent's grid by guessing coordinates. 
Hits are marked with an "X" and misses with a "*", and the first player to sink all of their opponentâ€™s ships wins. 
The game ensures valid ship placements by preventing overlaps and keeping ships within the grid boundaries.
*right now, game created for 2 players to see their own board and opposing board due to player overlay. Can be switched to no visiual aid in future.*
