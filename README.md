This project is a two-player version of the classic Battleship game implemented in Python. 
Players take turns placing their ships on a 10x10 grid, choosing both the position and orientation (horizontal or vertical) for each ship. 
Once ship placement is complete, players alternate turns attacking their opponent's grid by guessing coordinates. 
Hits are marked with an "X" and misses with a "*", and the first player to sink all of their opponentâ€™s ships wins. 
The game ensures valid ship placements by preventing overlaps and keeping ships within the grid boundaries.
